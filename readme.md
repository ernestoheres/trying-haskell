# Learning haskell

Haskell seems interesting so I want to try it!

## Setup

There's a flake so just install nix and
`nix develop`
if ur using direnv remember to do
```direnv allow````

## How to use

so far i have just made some functions in some files
we can use this like this
1 start interactive haskell shell
`ghci`
2 load module ( lets use lists module as a example here)
`:l lists`
3 yay loaded now you can call the functions within
`triangles`
